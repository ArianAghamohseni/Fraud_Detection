# XGB Fraud Detection

This project focuses on the development of a machine learning model to detect fraudulent transactions. By leveraging the powerful XGBoost algorithm, we aim to identify potentially fraudulent activities in financial transactions.

## Overview

The notebook contains a comprehensive approach to load and preprocess transaction data, with a focus on excluding redundant columns determined by correlation analysis to enhance model performance. Specifically, it includes steps for data loading, preprocessing, and model training using XGBoost.
